# Quick Message from Authors:

  Hi! Just here to tell you that we are NOT responsible for 
    any improper EAS activations that occur because of use of
    this program. If for some reason that equiptment is 
    activated, the person responsible for activating such 
    is whom transmitted it. We have disabled some event codes
    just in case. but Please, for the love of everything holy, 
    be responsible. Responsible people take the blame for what
    they have done. DO NOT send these tones over the airwaves.
    No matter what, you will be accountable for missuse of the
    tones. 

    AGAIN: YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SHENANIGANS! We aren't!
   


         Thank you for reading this, and by using this 
      program you agree to such terms above.
